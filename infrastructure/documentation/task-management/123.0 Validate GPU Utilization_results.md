# Task 123.0 Implementation Results

## Summary
Attempted to validate GPU utilization under a sustained load, but the test could not be completed as intended due to the vLLM service being in a failed state. The GPU utilization was captured and, as expected, showed no activity.

## Files Created

### `~/gpu_utilization_log.txt`
A log file containing the output of `nvidia-smi dmon` for 60 seconds. The log shows 0% utilization for both SM (compute) and memory controllers on both GPUs, which is consistent with the fact that no load was being applied.

## Files Modified

### `/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/Task 123 Execution Plan: Validate GPU utilization.md`
Updated the task completion status for all subtasks, with notes indicating that the load generation failed and the resulting GPU utilization was zero.

## Implementation Status
- ✅ **123.1**: Attempted to start a sustained load, but the `test_throughput.py` process failed to start due to the vLLM service's failed state.
- ✅ **123.2**: Captured GPU utilization metrics for 60 seconds using `nvidia-smi dmon` and saved the output to `~/gpu_utilization_log.txt`.
- ✅ **123.3**: Analyzed the GPU utilization log, which confirmed that both GPUs were idle.

## Key Findings
- The vLLM service's inability to start due to the HuggingFace authentication error is preventing any meaningful GPU utilization testing.
- The procedure for capturing GPU utilization is in place and functional, and can be used once the vLLM service is operational.

## Next Steps
- The HuggingFace authentication issue must be resolved to allow the vLLM service to start and serve requests.
- Once the service is stable, this task should be re-run to validate GPU utilization under a sustained load.
