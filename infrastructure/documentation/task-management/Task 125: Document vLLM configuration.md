## Task Implementation
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
  3. A task can be marked complete until it has been tested and passed.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.
   - Create a corresponding `.md` file in `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management`.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - At the conclusion of each task, summarize your work including all files created or modified.
   - Provide each summary as a separate `.md` file named after the task, appended with `_results`.  
     - Example: `125.0 Document vLLM Configuration_results.md`
   - Each file must include:
     - Every modified or created file path
     - A one-line description of its purpose

## Relevant Files

- `~/vllm_configuration_v1.md` – Primary markdown document detailing all configuration and tuning rationale for the vLLM service.
- `/etc/systemd/system/vllm.service` – Source service file included in documentation.
- `/opt/citadel/config/vllm/vllm.env` – Source environment configuration file included in documentation.
- `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/125.0 Document vLLM Configuration.md` – Task file tracking the documentation process.
- `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/125.0 Document vLLM Configuration_results.md` – Summary of document creation and commit status.

### Notes

- Documentation should follow Markdown linting and style standards.
- Explanations must include the reasoning behind each major runtime flag (parallelism, memory usage, CPU swap).
- Document should be moved or symlinked into the canonical documentation repository once complete.
