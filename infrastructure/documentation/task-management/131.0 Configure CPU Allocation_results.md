# Task 131.0: Configure CPU Allocation Results

## Files Modified

- `infrastructure/servers/01-llm-server/configs/systemd/vllm.service`: Attempted multiple methods to set CPU affinity.

## Validation

- **Method 1: `CPUAffinity`**
  - Added `CPUAffinity=0-15` to the `[Service]` section.
  - **Result:** Failed. One process had the correct affinity, but child processes did not.

- **Method 2: `AllowedCPUs`**
  - Replaced `CPUAffinity` with `AllowedCPUs=0-15`.
  - **Result:** Failed. Same outcome as `CPUAffinity`.

- **Method 3: `taskset` in `ExecStart`**
  - Prepended `ExecStart` with `taskset -c 0-15`.
  - **Result:** Failed. Same outcome as the other methods.

## Conclusion

The CPU affinity for the vLLM service could not be successfully configured using standard `systemd` directives or the `taskset` command. The vLLM application appears to spawn child processes that do not inherit the specified CPU affinity. Further investigation into vLLM's process management or a different approach to CPU pinning is required.
