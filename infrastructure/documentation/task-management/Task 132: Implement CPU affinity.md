## Task Implementation
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
  3. A task can be marked complete until it has been tested and passed.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.
   - Create a corresponding `.md` file in `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management`.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - At the conclusion of each task, summarize your work including all files created or modified.
   - Provide each summary as a separate `.md` file named after the task, appended with `_results`.  
     - Example: `132.0 Implement CPU Affinity_results.md`
   - Each file must include:
     - Every modified or created file path
     - A one-line description of its purpose

## Relevant Files

- `/etc/systemd/system/vllm.service` – Contains the `CPUAffinity=0-15` directive established in Task 131.
- `/opt/citadel/benchmarks/run_benchmarks.sh` – Benchmark orchestration script used to validate performance behavior under CPU isolation.
- `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/132.0 Implement CPU Affinity.md` – Task specification and validation checklist.
- `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/132.0 Implement CPU Affinity_results.md` – Confirmation log of affinity settings and benchmark verification.

### Notes

- Task 132 does not introduce changes, but serves as the **validation and behavioral audit** of Task 131’s CPUAffinity enforcement.
- Performance validation is observational — A/B comparison is impractical; focus is on **consistency** and **core-bound activity** during load.

## Tasks

- [x] 132.0 Implement CPU Affinity
  - [x] 132.1 Confirm Implementation
    - [x] Acknowledge that `CPUAffinity` directive is already in place via Task 131
  - [x] 132.2 Validate CPU Affinity Setting
    - [x] Retrieve vLLM PID with `pgrep`
    - [x] Run `taskset -p $PID` to confirm CPU core binding matches configured range
  - [x] 132.3 Validate Performance Improvement
    - [x] Run `/opt/citadel/benchmarks/run_benchmarks.sh`
    - [x] Observe core-restricted behavior in `htop` or `top`
    - [x] Confirm benchmark results remain consistent with prior baselines

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start next task without user’s instructions
