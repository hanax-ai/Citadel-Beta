## Task Implementation
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
  3. A task can be marked complete until it has been tested and passed.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.
   - Create a corresponding `.md` file in `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management`.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - At the conclusion of each task, summarize your work including all files created or modified.
   - Provide each summary as a separate `.md` file named after the task, appended with `_results`.  
     - Example: `124.0 Test Memory Efficiency_results.md`
   - Each file must include:
     - Every modified or created file path
     - A one-line description of its purpose

## Relevant Files

- `/opt/citadel/benchmarks/test_throughput.py` – High-concurrency inference load generator for memory stress testing.
- `~/memory_baseline.txt` – Captured baseline GPU memory usage with idle vLLM service.
- `~/memory_post_test.txt` – Captured post-load GPU memory usage after cooldown period.
- `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/124.0 Test Memory Efficiency.md` – Task definition file.
- `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/124.0 Test Memory Efficiency_results.md` – Post-run summary, memory delta analysis, and validation notes.

### Notes

- Key validation check: memory allocated by PagedAttention should be released cleanly after load stops.
- Service should be restarted before test if it was idle or stale.
- Memory leaks typically reveal themselves as persistent delta in `diff` output even after cooldown.

## Tasks

- [x] 124.0 Test Memory Efficiency
  - [x] 124.1 Record Baseline Idle Memory Usage
    - [x] Confirm `vllm.service` is running and idle
    - [x] Run `nvidia-smi | grep 'MiB' > ~/memory_baseline.txt`
  - [x] 124.2 Run Extended, Varied Load Test
    - [x] Confirm `test_throughput.py` exists and is up to date for this test
    - [x] Run `test_throughput.py --duration 1800 &` and save PID
    - [x] Monitor memory usage periodically via `watch -n 30 nvidia-smi`
  - [x] 124.3 Record Post-Test Idle Memory Usage and Validate
    - [x] Kill test process with `kill $TEST_PID`
    - [x] Wait 2 minutes for memory to deallocate (`sleep 120`)
    - [x] Run `nvidia-smi | grep 'MiB' > ~/memory_post_test.txt`
    - [x] Run `diff ~/memory_baseline.txt ~/memory_post_test.txt`
    - [x] Validate that output shows no significant memory discrepancy
