# Task 132: Implement CPU Affinity - Results

## Summary

This task focused on validating the CPU affinity settings for the vLLM service. The initial investigation revealed that the `CPUAffinity` directive in the `/etc/systemd/system/vllm.service` file was not being applied.

## Files Modified

- `/etc/systemd/system/vllm.service`: Attempted to enforce CPU affinity by using `taskset` in the `ExecStart` directive. This change was reverted after it failed to resolve the issue and caused the service to become unstable.

## Key Findings

- **CPU Affinity Not Applied**: Despite the presence of `CPUAffinity=0-15` in the systemd service file, the vLLM processes were not bound to the specified cores. The affinity mask remained `ffff`, indicating that all cores were being used.
- **Manual `taskset` Fails**: Attempts to manually set the CPU affinity using the `taskset` command also failed, suggesting that the application itself might be overriding the affinity settings.
- **Service Instability**: Modifying the service file to use `taskset` in the `ExecStart` directive caused the vLLM service to fail to start correctly, making the API endpoint unavailable.

## Recommendations

- **Application-Level Investigation**: The root cause of the CPU affinity issue likely lies within the vLLM application itself. Further investigation is needed to determine if the application is overriding the system-level affinity settings.
- **Alternative Affinity Methods**: Explore alternative methods for setting CPU affinity, such as using `numactl` or other tools that might be more effective in this environment.
- **Service Configuration Review**: A thorough review of the vLLM service configuration is recommended to ensure that all settings are optimal and compatible with the underlying system.
