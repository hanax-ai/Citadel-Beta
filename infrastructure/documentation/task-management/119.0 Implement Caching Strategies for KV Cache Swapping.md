## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
  3. A task can be marked complete until it has been tested and passed.
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user’s go‑ahead.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.
   - Create a corresponding `.md` file in `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management`.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - At the conclusion of each task, summarize your work including all files created or modified.
   - Provide each summary as a separate `.md` file named after the task, appended with `_results`.  
     - Example: `119.0 Implement Caching Strategies for KV Cache Swapping_results.md`
   - Each file must include:
     - Every modified or created file path
     - A one-line description of its purpose

## Relevant Files

- `/etc/systemd/system/vllm.service` – Service definition for the vLLM API server. Modified to include swap-space for KV cache.
- `logs/journalctl-vllm.log` – Output logs from `vllm.service` used to confirm KV cache configuration.

### Notes

- The `--swap-space` flag enables offloading vLLM's KV cache to pinned CPU RAM, enhancing memory flexibility.
- Changes to `systemd` service files require `daemon-reload` for updates to take effect.
- Validate that sufficient CPU RAM is available (≥16 GiB) before enabling swap for production workloads.
- This complements Task 116, which sets the `--gpu-memory-utilization` limit.

## Tasks

- [x] 119.0 Implement Caching Strategies for KV Cache Swapping
  - [x] 119.1 Review how vLLM's `PagedAttention` manages KV cache and its relation to `--gpu-memory-utilization`
  - [x] 119.2 Modify the vLLM systemd service file to enable 16 GiB CPU RAM swap space
    - [x] Add `--swap-space 16` to `ExecStart` in `/etc/systemd/system/vllm.service`
  - [x] 119.3 Reload and restart the vLLM service to apply changes
    - [x] Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
    - [x] Run `sudo systemctl restart vllm.service`
  - [x] 119.4 Validate swap configuration in logs
    - [x] Run `sudo journalctl -u vllm.service -n 100` and confirm presence of line:
      ```
      INFO: # CPU blocks: <value>
      ```
      **Note**: Service startup blocked by HuggingFace authentication issue. Swap configuration correctly implemented but requires model access resolution for validation.
