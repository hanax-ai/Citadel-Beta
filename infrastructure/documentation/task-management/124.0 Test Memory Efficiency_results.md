# Task 124.0: Test Memory Efficiency Results

## Summary

The memory efficiency test was conducted to validate that memory allocated by PagedAttention is released cleanly after a sustained load test. The test involved recording baseline memory, running a 30-minute throughput test, and comparing memory usage after a cooldown period.

The `diff` analysis between the baseline and post-test memory snapshots showed no significant memory leaks, confirming the efficient memory management of the vLLM service.
