## Task Implementation
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
  3. A task can be marked complete until it has been tested and passed.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.
   - Create a corresponding `.md` file in `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management`.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - At the conclusion of each task, summarize your work including all files created or modified.
   - Provide each summary as a separate `.md` file named after the task, appended with `_results`.  
     - Example: `135.0 Optimize CPU Usage_results.md`
   - Each file must include:
     - Every modified or created file path
     - A one-line description of its purpose

## Relevant Files

- `/opt/citadel/benchmarks/test_throughput.py` – Benchmark script used to generate load for CPU usage observation.
- `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/135.0 Optimize CPU Usage.md` – Task file for execution traceability.
- `/home/agent0/Citadel-Beta/infrastructure/documentation/task-management/135.0 Optimize CPU Usage_results.md` – Results summary documenting CPU config validation and runtime behavior.

### Notes

- This task is dependent on the completion and correctness of:
  - Task 041 (CPU Governor = performance)
  - Task 131 (CPU Affinity = 0–15)
  - Task 133 (SCHED_FIFO with priority 90)
- Observation should confirm **core isolation** and **non-interference** from system services during benchmark execution.

## Tasks

- [ ] 135.0 Optimize CPU Usage
  - [ ] 135.1 Review and Consolidate All CPU Optimizations
    - [ ] Confirm CPU governor:
      ```bash
      cpufreq-info | grep "The governor"
      ```
    - [ ] Confirm vLLM CPU affinity:
      ```bash
      taskset -p $(pgrep -f "vllm.entrypoints.api_server")
      ```
    - [ ] Confirm vLLM scheduling policy:
      ```bash
      chrt -p $(pgrep -f "vllm.entrypoints.api_server")
      ```
    - [ ] Validate all values match previous configuration tasks (041, 131, 133)
  - [ ] 135.2 Run Benchmark and Observe CPU Patterns
    - [ ] Execute:
      ```bash
      ./test_throughput.py --duration 120
      ```
    - [ ] In separate terminal, run `htop` to observe:
      - Load is concentrated on CPU cores `0-15`
      - Remaining cores remain idle or minimal

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start next task without user’s instructions
