## Executive Summary

After reviewing the HANA-X Inference Architecture Amendment document, I notice that while it provides excellent architectural details for the existing 6-model setup, **DeepCoder-14B is not explicitly mentioned** in the document. However, based on the user's indication that DeepCoder-14B is "an integral part of the current stack for code understanding, generation, and debugging," I will integrate it as the **seventh specialized model** in the HANA-X architecture.

## DeepCoder-14B Integration Specifications

Based on the architectural patterns established in the amendment document and the specific role of code understanding, generation, and debugging, I propose the following integration:

### Model Specifications
- **Model**: DeepCoder-14B
- **Role**: Code Understanding, Generation & Debugging
- **Serving Method**: vLLM (consistent with other text-only models)
- **Proposed Port**: 11405 (following the sequential port assignment pattern)
- **Node Assignment**: LLM Node (192.168.10.29) with other vLLM instances

### Task Router Integration
The intelligent task router will be enhanced to detect code-related requests and route them to DeepCoder-14B:

**Routing Logic Examples:**
- `"Debug this Python function"` → DeepCoder-14B
- `"Generate a REST API endpoint"` → DeepCoder-14B  
- `"Explain this code snippet"` → DeepCoder-14B
- `"Refactor this JavaScript function"` → DeepCoder-14B
- `"Write unit tests for this class"` → DeepCoder-14B

### Updated Model Stack Table

| Role | Model | Serving Method | Port | Description |
|------|-------|----------------|------|-------------|
| Generalist LLM | Mixtral-8x7B | vLLM | 11400 | Default fallback for reasoning agents |
| RAG & QA | Nous Hermes 2 Mistral | vLLM | 11401 | Clean RAG-aware generation |
| Dialogue + Tools | OpenChat 3.5 | vLLM | 11402 | For plug-in agents and interactive flows |
| Fast Micro Agent | Phi-3 Mini | vLLM | 11403 | Fast fallback or short task executor |
| Long-Document Summary | Yi-34B | vLLM | 11404 | Supports 32K token inputs |
| **Code Understanding** | **DeepCoder-14B** | **vLLM** | **11405** | **Code generation, debugging, and analysis** |
| Vision + Language | MiMo-VL-7B-RL | Standalone FastAPI | 11500 | Handles screenshots, GUI reasoning, captioning |

## Implementation Considerations

### Resource Requirements
- **GPU Memory**: Additional VRAM allocation for DeepCoder-14B (estimated 28GB for 14B parameter model)
- **Processing Power**: Dedicated compute resources for code inference operations
- **Storage**: Model weights and cache storage requirements

### Service Management
- **systemd Integration**: Consistent service management with other vLLM instances
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for code intelligence services
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent distribution of code-related requests

### Security and Access Control
- **Code Privacy**: Secure handling of proprietary code and intellectual property
- **Access Controls**: Appropriate permissions for code analysis and generation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of code intelligence operations

## Conclusion

The integration of DeepCoder-14B as the seventh specialized model significantly enhances the HANA-X Inference Architecture by providing dedicated code intelligence capabilities. This addition completes the comprehensive AI platform with specialized models for all major use cases: general reasoning, RAG, dialogue, fast operations, long context, vision-language, and code intelligence.

The proposed integration follows the established architectural patterns while providing the essential code understanding, generation, and debugging capabilities that are integral to a complete AI development platform.
